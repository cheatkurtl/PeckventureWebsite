    The aim of this report is to show how the knowledge of the Traffic laws gets lost after passig the drinving test
    As can be seen the knowledge of the trffic laws extremly decreases after passing the drinving test
    To improve the current situation we could do some tests after the drinving test or we could decres the stuff we ned to learn so we remember more because its not that much anymore
    All in all, we dont know that much after the driving test as we knew bevore so its useless in general.
